# Basic Linear Algebra Subprogram (BLAS): description of fastest elementary matrix / vector operations
# The Fortran realization of BLAS is provided by 'OpenBlas', and should be the fastest implementation
# without vendor lock.
#
# Intel's Math Kerner Library (MKL) is normally the best choice for even faster linear algebra code,
# but as the name suggests it is not available on AMD Machines. Also our HPC CPUs are too old ...
#
# Capital letters required here and in the following, I learned it the hard way ...
find_package(BLAS REQUIRED)    

# The Linear Algebra Package (LAPACK) makes use of the operations defined in BLAS to provide the actual 
# linear algebra stuff (e.g. equation solver or SVD), Numpy also uses it in the background.
#
# OpenLapack provides the implementation similar to OpenBlas, Intel MKL would be faster and has everything
# included (BLAS + LAPACK + OpenMP), but Intel is greedy and restricts it to their CPUs ...
